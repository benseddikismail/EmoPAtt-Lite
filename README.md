# EmoPAtt-Lite: Lightweight Facial Emotion Recognition

## Abstract
Facial expressions play a vital role in human communication, serving as a potent means to convey a broad spectrum of emotions. With the advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision, deep neural networks have emerged as effective tools for recognizing facial emotions. In this study, we introduce EmoPAtt-Lite, a lightweight network based on MobileNetV1. We utilize a truncated MobileNetV1 pre-trained on ImageNet as the underlying feature extractor, accompanied by a novel attention classifier tailored to augment learning from the feature maps generated by the lightweight extractor. We also integrate a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) to enable neural networks to learn and apply spatial transformations to input data. Additionally, we include a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block to bolster the representational capacity of the patch extraction convolutional network.
